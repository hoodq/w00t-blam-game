This is a program that allows the user to add his or her own players by a "name, health" format via a csv file.
And from there, the user is asked how many rounds of the game he or she would like to iterate through.
Then, each round, each player will roll a dice and either be w00ted or blammed, adding or taking away health and points from the overall score.
Each player will also find one of several treasures chosen at random that will add points to the overall score.
Once the first set of iterations finishes, the user may add more rounds to this ongoing game if desired, otherwise the 'quit' command can end the game.
When the game finishes, this gem will list out all of the found treasures of the players and their effect on the overall score.
It also lists out the scores of the players from highest to lowest and saves this result in another csv file that is automatically created.
